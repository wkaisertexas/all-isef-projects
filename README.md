## ISEF Database

This is a simple web scraper which gets all of the projects and abstract information from [here](https://abstracts.scienceforsociety.org). 

### Goal
I want someone to get inspired to do a "meta" science fair project. Someone could look at what makes science fair projects sucessful *in* in science fair project. Comedy.

### To use:
Run the code in Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/williamkaiser/get-isef-database)

Alternatively, do not. There is already a dataset based on this scraping located [here](

### FAQ

The original version of this used a bunch of split and replace commands because I had no idea how to do text processing, but now the program uses Beautiful soup and it is much nicer.
