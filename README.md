# ISEF Database

This is a simple web scraper which gets all of the projects and abstract information from [Science for Society's website](https://abstracts.scienceforsociety.org). 

> I wrote an **article** based on this data **[available on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/analytics/post-summary/urn:li:activity:7066812526662979584/)**.

### Goal
I want someone to get inspired to do a "meta" science fair project. Someone could look at what makes science fair projects sucessful *in* in science fair project. Comedy.

### To use:
Run the code in Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/williamkaiser/all-isef-projects).

#### History
This was my first web-based programming project. Written in 8th grade, I wanted to inspire someone to make a meta science fair project. Because the original code was so terrible, I rewrote it in a Kaggle notebook, and the code turned out much cleaner (mostly due to tqdm). 

Now, this database is published on Kaggle, and a competition is started for analyzing this dataset. This should be fun.

I will be submitting an entry as I have more time my senior year. All in all, if you are intrested in data science at all, and would like to try your hand at a relatively small dataset, go ahead.
